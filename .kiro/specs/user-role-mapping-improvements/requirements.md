# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on improving the existing UserBusinessRoleMappingController by enhancing business logic, adding comprehensive validation, improving error handling, and introducing new functionality for better user role management. The improvements will make the controller more robust, maintainable, and feature-complete while maintaining backward compatibility.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want improved validation and error handling in role mapping operations, so that I can prevent invalid data states and get clear feedback when operations fail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user attempts to onboard a role with invalid or missing data THEN the system SHALL return specific validation error messages
2. WHEN a user tries to assign a role that already exists for a user-business combination THEN the system SHALL prevent duplicate assignments and return appropriate error
3. WHEN a user attempts to access resources outside their business scope THEN the system SHALL enforce strict business boundary validation
4. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL return structured error responses with field-level details

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a hospital administrator, I want to manage user roles more comprehensively, so that I can have full control over staff assignments and role modifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I need to update an existing user's role THEN the system SHALL provide endpoints to modify role assignments
2. WHEN I need to remove a user from a role THEN the system SHALL provide secure deactivation/removal functionality
3. WHEN I need to view all role assignments for my hospital THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive listing with filtering options
4. WHEN I need to transfer a user between roles THEN the system SHALL provide role transfer functionality

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a super administrator, I want enhanced bulk operations and advanced management features, so that I can efficiently manage multiple hospitals and large-scale role assignments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I need to perform bulk role assignments THEN the system SHALL provide batch processing capabilities
2. WHEN I need to audit role changes THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive audit trails
3. WHEN I need to manage cross-hospital assignments THEN the system SHALL support multi-business role management
4. WHEN I need to generate reports THEN the system SHALL provide role assignment analytics and reporting

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the system, I want cleaner, more maintainable code structure, so that the controller is easier to understand, test, and extend.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the code THEN the system SHALL have clear separation of concerns with extracted helper methods
2. WHEN adding new functionality THEN the system SHALL follow consistent patterns and naming conventions
3. WHEN handling business logic THEN the system SHALL have reduced code duplication through shared utility methods
4. WHEN testing the controller THEN the system SHALL have improved testability through better method organization

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want consistent and comprehensive response formats, so that I can reliably integrate with the role mapping endpoints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calling any endpoint THEN the system SHALL return consistent response structures
2. WHEN operations succeed THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful success messages with relevant data
3. WHEN operations fail THEN the system SHALL return standardized error formats with actionable information
4. WHEN paginating results THEN the system SHALL provide consistent pagination metadata

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a security-conscious administrator, I want enhanced authorization controls and audit capabilities, so that I can ensure proper access control and track all role-related activities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users access role management functions THEN the system SHALL enforce granular permission checks
2. WHEN role assignments are modified THEN the system SHALL log all changes with user attribution
3. WHEN sensitive operations are performed THEN the system SHALL require additional validation steps
4. WHEN unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL log security events and block access
